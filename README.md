mediancut
=========

This is an implementation of Paul Debevec's [A Median Cut Algorithm for Light Probe Sampling](http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/MedianCut/). The code generates sample positions for 2^n light sources. You will still need to sum up the energy of the respective cut region to get the final flux. To run the sample, please fetch [Sean Barrett's stb_image](http://nothings.org/).
